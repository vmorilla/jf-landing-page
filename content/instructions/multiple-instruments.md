## Instrument and tuning

![Instruments](/images/instructions/instruments.gif#floatright)

You can choose between different instruments (guitar, bass, banjo, ukelele...) and different tunings in the settings menu (top right side of the screen). The fretboards view on the right side of the page will be updated with fretboards representing your selection. The notes of chords and scales in your song will be shown automatically.

Let us know if you miss your instrument or your favourite tuning.

## Tonality of the theme

![Tonality](/images/instructions/tonality.gif#floatright)

You can also change the tonality of the theme so that you can practice in a different area of the fretboard. Or maybe just to adapt it to your vocal range. Just click on the tonality by the title of the theme and select the one you want.
