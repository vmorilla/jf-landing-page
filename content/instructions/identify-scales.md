You can add the scales that correspond to the chords in the harmony of your theme. Click on the "**no scale**" text at the header of the corresponding fretboard of a chord, and choose one of the scales available (those that contain the chord selected).

The representation of notes in the fretboard (in *edit mode*), goes like this:
- A square for the root note
- A diamond for arpeggio / chord notes
- A circle for the rest of the notes that belong to the chosen scale

You can also add scales by chosing its individual notes in the fretboard. Make sure the chord / scale selector is set to "scale" and click the notes in the fretboard.
