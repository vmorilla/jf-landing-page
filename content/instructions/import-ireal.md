With JazzForge you can open your iReal Pro files or browse through thousands of themes publicly available on the internet.

## Browse publicly available charts
![Opening iReal](/images/instructions/import_ireal.gif#floatright)
Just click on the app menu (â˜°) and chose "Import iReal Pro song...". In the search bar start typing the name of the song you want to open. Click once on any of the titles available to preview the song and then click the "Open" button.

JazzForge browses through the content of the [main iReal Pro playlists](https://www.irealpro.com/main-playlists), which contain a compilation of the most important chord charts available in the forums. These include Jazz, Brazilian, Latin, Blues, Pop and Country chord charts.

## Open a song published in iReal Pro forums

Sometimes, the song you want to view is not available in the main playlists of iReal Pro, however, it is very likely someone has worked on it and has published in the forums. If so, just open your browser, go to [iReal Pro forums](https://www.irealb.com/forums/forum.php) and look for the title you are interested in. You should find a link that starts with "ireal://". Copy the link and go back to JazzForge and click on "Import iReal Pro song...". In the search bar, paste the link you have copied. The song or collection you have copied should show up in the dialog box. Just click on the title to preview the song and then on the "Open" button.

In the video to the left, you can see how you can open the chord chart of the song "For a Thousand Years" of the great Pat Metheny.

## Open a song edited with iReal Pro

You can also import songs directly edited in iReal Pro by exporting in iReal Pro format: this menu command produces an html file that, when opened, includes a link that you can copy and use in JazzForge. Go to "Import iReal Pro song..." in JazzForge and, in the search bar, paste the link you have copied. The song you have copied should show up in the dialog box. Just click on the title to preview the song and then click on the "Open" button.
